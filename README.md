# Embedded Night Light

This repository contains three variants of an embedded night light project, built with Arduino Uno and written in C++.

## Project Variants
1. **Night Light Remote Button Reader**: Reads and decodes IR remote signals.
2. **Night Light Potentiometer**: Adjusts LED brightness using a potentiometer.
3. **Night Light IR Remote Controller**: Combines IR remote functionality for brightness and power control.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno (ATmega328P)
- LEDs (x6)
- Potentiometer
- IR Receiver & IR Remote Controller
- Jumper Wires and Breadboard

About the Microcontroller
The Arduino Uno uses the ATmega328P, an 8-bit AVR microcontroller with:

16 MHz Clock Speed
32 KB Flash Memory
6 PWM Outputs
